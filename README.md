# WebGPT

**WebGPT** is a simple WebView wrapper for [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), based on the open source project [gptAssist](https://github.com/woheller69/gptAssist).

This is a modified version intended for public use under the terms of the GNU General Public License v3.0.

## Modifications

Compared to the original gptAssist:

- App renamed to **WebGPT**
- Changed package name to `com.qomarhsn.webgpt`
- Replaced the original icon with a custom one
- Removed the third-party URL block icon and related logic
- Configured WebView to open only ChatGPT and login pages internally; other links open in external browser
